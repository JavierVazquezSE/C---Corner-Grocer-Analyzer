# C---Corner-Grocer-Analyzer


### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project allows the grocer to see the amount of items sold at their store for a particular day.

### What did you do particularly well?
I was able to create a menu for the grocer to see the data in various options.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Enhancements can still be done in input validation.

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Everytime I ran into a blocker, I researched using course work, StackOverflow, and other online resources such as W3Schools.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I enriched my knowledge of the C++ language and improved my debugging skills.

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I broke the project into class and function files. Rather than everything being in the main project file, files were seperated for better readability.
